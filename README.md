# ReadableTempoJira

Time float display isn't the best way to quickly read time. So this user script add hours and minutes to each time value.

You can easily use this script with extensions :
* [Greasemonkey for Firefox](http://www.greasespot.net/)
* [Tampermonkey for Chrome](http://tampermonkey.net) : Just go to [raw page script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoZOo/ReadableTempoJira/master/ReadableTempoJira.user.js) once Tampermonkey is installed to install script.
